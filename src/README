 ***** Steps to run ***
1) bash testPolygonNN3.sh 10000 20000  12
This script is akin to testPolygonNN.sh, which runs creates sample datasets and perform KNN search. It also helps compare the KNN improvements added by doing the following.

The script will create two datasets of size 10000 and 20000 respectively and the last argument '12' causes a file called sample12.txt to be created.
This sample file will contain metrics about the improvements brought about by the usage of KNN indexes (Generated by precomputation which is a step before the resque is called in this script).

The preprocess (src/spatialproc/preprocess.cpp) program will basically create KNN indexes (test/knn_idx_file.txt) for each object in dataset 1. It generates the distances at which neighbors can be found for k = [1, 4, 9, 16]. 

The resque_knn process (src/spatialproc/resque_knn.cpp) will read the above index (test/knn_idx_file.txt) and choose an appropriate default radius to obtain KNN.

The script to build KNN indexes is test/build_knn_index.sh. This script is called in testPolygonNN3.sh


2) To just compare the algorithms run_rsq2.sh script can be used, but make sure that tmpData/inputreducer and test/knn_idx_file.txt are generated already. It captures 3 metrics for each version of algorithm (version being with/without KNN index precomputation usage).
a) Num KNN search iterations overall for all objects included
b) Num objects selected from KNN search overall
c) Time taken for resque 

3) To compare the algorithms the following commands can be used

bash run_rsq2.sh false  2>> sample12.txt 1>> sample12.txt
bash ../test/build_knn_index.sh
bash run_rsq2.sh true 2>> sample12.txt 1>> sample12.txt

And the contents of sample12.txt will look like below

Use precomputed knn indexes: false
num_iterations:36175 num objs selected 5022407
Time taken: 74177

Use precomputed knn indexes: true
num_iterations:20410 num objs selected 2429260
Time taken: 44180
